I am an ðŸ”­astronomerðŸ”­ keen on sharing my experience and expertise via my codes! I thouroughly check my implementations for accuracy, but these are still research codes, and they may contain bugs: If you use my codes, please give me feedback (report issues, request features, etc). The codes below have reference publications, and have been used in more than 120 refereed publications as of mid-2025. 

- [SPIPS](https://github.com/amerand/SPIPS3) models spectroscopic, photometric and interferometric time series observations of Cepheids pulsating stars. It is used to derive fundamental parameters, and interpolated light curves. It is described in [MÃ©rand et al. A&A 581-80 (2015)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2015/12/aa25954-15.pdf). âœ¨Highlightâœ¨ It has been used to create a PCA templates of light curve to re-analise independetly some of the SH0ES data in [Javanmardi, MÃ©rand et al. ApJ 911-12 (2021)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abe7e5/pdf) to measure the Hubble constant 
- [CANDID](https://github.com/amerand/CANDID) aims at detecting faint companions around stars in interferometric data, co-developped with Alexandre Gallenne (who hosts a [version with a GUI](https://github.com/agallenne/GUIcandid)). It gives you an upper limt for non-detection. The algorithms are described in [Gallenne, MÃ©rand et al. A&A 579-68 (2015)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2015/07/aa25917-15.pdf). âœ¨Highlightâœ¨ CANDID has been used in [75 refereed publications](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=citations(bibcode%3A2015A%26A...579A..68G)&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0) in 10 years! 
- [PMOIRED](https://github.com/amerand/PMOIRED) is an advanced tool to model interferometric data and help astrophyscal interpretation. The algorithms are described in [MÃ©rand, SPIE Volume 12183, id. 121831N (2022)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022SPIE12183E..1NM/abstract) âœ¨Highlightâœ¨ It was used to [disprove the presence of a black hole in the HR6819 system](https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso2204/), as published in [Frost et al. A&A 659-L3 (2022)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2022/03/aa43004-21.pdf), or to show that Gl229b is a binary brown dwarf ([Xuan, MÃ©rand et al. Nature (2024)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024Natur.634.1070X/abstract))
